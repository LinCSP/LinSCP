# LinSCP

**LinSCP** is a cross-platform SFTP/SSH file manager for Linux, built with C++20 and Qt 6.
It aims to bring the familiar WinSCP experience to Linux and other Unix-like systems.


## Features

- **Dual-pane interface** — local and remote file browsers side by side
- **SFTP file operations** — browse, upload, download, rename, delete, chmod, mkdir
- **SSH channel multiplexing** — SFTP and terminal share a single SSH connection
- **Authentication** — password, public key (RSA/Ed25519/ECDSA), SSH agent
- **Session manager** — save/load profiles with AES-256-GCM encrypted passwords
- **SSH key manager** — generate, import, export, and convert keys (PuTTY PPK ↔ OpenSSH)
- **Transfer queue** — parallel transfers with progress, speed, and ETA display
- **Directory synchronization** — compare local ↔ remote and sync in either direction
- **Known hosts management** — verify and trust remote host keys
- **SCP protocol support** — as a fallback when SFTP is unavailable

## Screenshots

> Coming soon — the project is in early development (v0.1-dev).

## Requirements

| Dependency | Minimum version |
|------------|----------------|
| C++ compiler | GCC 11 / Clang 14 (C++20) |
| CMake | 3.25 |
| Qt | 6.5 |
| libssh | 0.10 |
| OpenSSL | 3.0 |

Optional:
- **qtermwidget6** — embedded terminal emulator (`-DWITH_TERMINAL=ON`)
- **libsecret** — GNOME Keyring / KWallet integration (`-DWITH_KEYRING=ON`)

## Building

```bash
# Install dependencies (Arch Linux)
sudo pacman -S qt6-base cmake libssh openssl ninja

# Install dependencies (Ubuntu 24.04 / Debian 12)
sudo apt install qt6-base-dev cmake libssh-dev libssl-dev ninja-build

# Install dependencies (Fedora 39+)
sudo dnf install qt6-qtbase-devel cmake libssh-devel openssl-devel ninja-build

# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/linscp.git
cd linscp
cmake -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
./build/src/linscp
```

### Optional features

```bash
# With embedded terminal
cmake -B build -G Ninja -DWITH_TERMINAL=ON

# With system keyring (GNOME/KDE)
cmake -B build -G Ninja -DWITH_KEYRING=ON
```

## Architecture

LinSCP is organized around these core components:

- **`linscp::core::ssh`** — `SshSession` wraps a `libssh` session with a state machine (Disconnected → Connecting → VerifyingHost → Authenticating → Connected). Multiple `SshChannel` objects (SFTP, Shell, Exec) share one `ssh_session_t`.
- **`linscp::core::sftp`** — `SftpClient` provides the full SFTP API. Directory listings are loaded asynchronously via `QThreadPool`.
- **`linscp::core::transfer`** — Thread-safe `TransferQueue` + `TransferManager` that runs transfers in a worker pool.
- **`linscp::core::sync`** — `SyncComparator` diffs local ↔ remote trees and feeds deltas to `SyncEngine`.
- **`linscp::core::session`** — `SessionProfile` serialized to JSON, with passwords encrypted using AES-256-GCM (OpenSSL EVP).
- **`linscp::models`** — `RemoteFsModel` / `LocalFsModel` implement `QAbstractItemModel` for the dual-pane view.

## Running tests

```bash
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```
